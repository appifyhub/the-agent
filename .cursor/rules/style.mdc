### Code style

#### General

By default, follow the language's best practices. Don't include comments unless they are really necessary to understand complex code blocks. Most code blocks are not complex enough to require comments. Avoid TODOs and FIXMEs, and any explanations in comments directed towards the user/author.

Always start with modifying the main code. When done, look for tests and update them (if any). Confirm with the user before creating new test files.

#### Python

In Python, I want you to use the latest type syntax (`type | None`) instead of `Optional`. I also want you to use a single space (`=`) around the equals sign (`=`) in function argument calls. It's important to use double quotation marks (`"`) instead of single quotations (`'`). And finally, we want to always use trailing commas in multi-line function declarations and calls.

#### JavaScript/TypeScript

In JavaScript and TypeScript, use types as much as possible: strict mode will be turned on! If in doubt, follow Java standard formatting. Finally, we also always want trailing commas in multi-line code blocks.

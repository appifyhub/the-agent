### How to run?

This project uses `pipenv`.

Using `pipenv`, you can run `pipenv install` in the root directory to set up your dependencies correctly. After the dependencies have been installed, you can run `pipenv shell` to get a new shell fork in which the environment will be set up to easily run everything.

Once the environment has been configured, you can run the main code with:

```console
$ python src/main.py
```

You can run all tests in verbose mode (`-v`) with:

```console
$ pytest -v
```
